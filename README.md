# Mini-chess-engine

- Homemade mini chess engine and game written in C++ during couple of evenings (about 1300 LOC of C++) 
- AI uses Negascout algorithm with variable search depth
- Game is just in CLI with "UCI-like" interface
- Using Piece square tables (PST) for board evaluation
- Support of en passant move/capture, castling, three fold repetition, king check detection, draw detection, etc. - yet still not a full chess game engine like Stockfish
- Written in C++17, CMake is available
- Feel free to report a bug
- *Disclaimer*: I am not chess expert, this engine is made just for fun and curiosity
